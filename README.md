# Autonomous-Fault-Detection-Model
A machine learning project designed to automatically detect system faults or anomalies in real time using sensor data. This model applies supervised and unsupervised learning techniques — including Random Forest, SVM, and Autoencoders — to classify normal vs. faulty behavior.
